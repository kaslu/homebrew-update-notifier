# OS&thinsp;X Homebrew Update Notifier

A little script to announce outdated [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) formulas in the OS&thinsp;X Notification Center.

## Installation

**Prerequisites**:

- [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), of course.
- [terminal-notifier](https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier) is for sending the results of the script to the Notification Center.
Install with `brew install terminal-notifier`.

Download the script and place it in your environment path (how about `/usr/local/bin`?) and give it executable rights: `chmod +x /usr/local/bin/homebrew-update-notifier`.

## Usage/Automation

This script doesnâ€™t make much sense without some automation. The easiest way is to fire it from a [launchd](http://alvinalexander.com/mac-os-x/mac-osx-startup-crontab-launchd-jobs) entry.

1. Copy the example launch agent file into your user library: `cp opt/homebrew.update-notifier.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.update-notifier.plist`
2. Modify the starting times and and other settings to your flavour
3. Start with `launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.update-notifier.plist`. (You can halt the process by using _unload_ as launchctl command).
