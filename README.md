# OS&thinsp;X Homebrew Update Notifier

A little script to announce outdated [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) formulas in the OS&thinsp;X Notification Center.

## Installation

**Prerequisites**:

- [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), of course.
- [terminal-notifier](https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier) is for sending the results of the script to the Notification Center.
Install with `brew install terminal-notifier`.

Download the script and place it in your environment path (how about `/usr/local/bin`?) and give it executable rights: `chmod +x /usr/local/bin/homebrew-update-notifier`.

## Usage/Automation

This script doesnâ€™t make much sense without some automation. The easiest way is to fire it from a [launchd](http://alvinalexander.com/mac-os-x/mac-osx-startup-crontab-launchd-jobs) entry.

1. Put the following lines (modify the starting times and and other settings to your flavour) into `~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.update-notifier.plist`:

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
    <plist version="1.0">
    <dict>
        <key>EnableGlobbing</key>
        <false/>
        <key>Label</key>
        <string>homebrew.update-notifier</string>
        <key>ProgramArguments</key>
        <array>
            <string>/bin/bash</string>
            <string>/usr/local/bin/homebrew-update-notifier</string>
        </array>
        <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
        <string>/usr/local/var/log/homebrew.update-notifier.log</string>
        <key>StandardOutPath</key>
        <string>/usr/local/var/log/homebrew.update-notifier.log</string>
        <key>RunAtLoad</key>
        <true/>
        <key>StartCalendarInterval</key>
        <array>
            <dict>
                <key>Hour</key>
                <integer>10</integer>
                <key>Minute</key>
                <integer>0</integer>
            </dict>
            <dict>
                <key>Hour</key>
                <integer>15</integer>
                <key>Minute</key>
                <integer>0</integer>
            </dict>
        </array>
    </dict>
    </plist>
    ```

2. Start with `launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.update-notifier.plist`. (You can halt the process by using _unload_ as launchctl command).
